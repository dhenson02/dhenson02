### Sup

I ‚ù§ JS, SQL, ES, SH, *all of it*.  Has to be on **Linux**, with my trusty **WebStorm**.

Sometimes I just make new boilerplates to see how much I can improve the previous version (*I'll make them public eventually*).  Or maybe I'll spend a bit of time changing someone else's lib to work the way I need it to in a strange use-case (like with [join-monster](https://github.com/dhenson02/join-monster-cuz) and [fixed-data-table](https://github.com/dhenson02/fixed-data-table-dk2) and [reach-router](https://github.com/dhenson02/router) )

A typical weekend for me
---
- Continue existing [Node Redis lib](https://github.com/dhenson02/libredis)
- LLM customization
- Challenges on occasion
  - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/lacoolj/)
  - [Code Signal](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/lacoolj)
- Start a new project
  - Pull in one of those boilerplates from before
    - Probly using one of: **React, Svelte, GraphQL, Koa, Electron**
    - Maybe throw some **Flow** on that b.
    - Next project, scrap it and jump into some **TypeScript**.
    - Then scrap that nonsense and go back to **Javascript**.
- Optimize existing SQL lying around
- Create custom new DB schema for hard-to-solve problems
  - For instance, a calendar DB schema to schedule appointments

Or I'm probly just playin some poke(r|mon)
