### Hey!

I ‚ù§ writing code.  

JS, SQL, ES, SH, *all of it*.  Has to be on **Linux**, with my trusty **WebStorm**.

Sometimes I just make new boilerplates to see how much I can improve the previous version (*I'll make them public eventually*).  Or maybe I'll spend a bit of time changing someone else's lib to work the way I need it to in a strange use-case (like with [join-monster](https://github.com/dhenson02/join-monster-cuz) and [fixed-data-table](https://github.com/dhenson02/fixed-data-table-dk2) and [reach-router](https://github.com/dhenson02/router) )

A typical weekend for me
---
- Start a new project
- Pull in one of those boilerplates from before :)
  - Lately this means one or more of the following will be included: 
    - **React, Svelte, GraphQL, Koa, Electron**
  - Improve it slightly (again)
- Throw in at least one new lib, framework, or hell a new language.
  - Throw some **Flow** on that b.
  - Next project, scrap it and jump into some **TypeScript**.

Anyways, if you want a peak at my private stash just hit me up.  Happy to throw a collab.
